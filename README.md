# Data Science Capstone Project: Peak Performance Across Sports

This project explores the concept of **peak athletic performance** across several major professional sports. Using data science tools and statistical modeling, we aimed to identify when athletes in different sports typically reach their peak and how long that peak performance period tends to last.

## üß† Project Overview

- **Objective**: Analyze athlete performance trajectories to determine the average age and duration of peak performance in sports like the NBA, NFL, MLB, and others.
- **Approach**: We aggregated player statistics over multiple seasons, normalized performance metrics, and modeled performance curves to identify peak periods.
- **Outcome**: Key insights were compiled into a visually compelling poster presentation summarizing findings and implications.

## üîç Key Insights (From Poster)

- **Different sports have different peak ages**: For example, NBA players tend to peak earlier than MLB pitchers.
- **Position matters**: Within each sport, peak performance windows vary significantly by position (e.g., QBs vs. RBs in football).
- **Duration of peak**: Some athletes maintain peak performance longer depending on the demands of their sport and position.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used

- **R / RStudio**: Data wrangling, modeling, and visualization
- `tidyverse`, `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, `lubridate`, and more
- **Statistical modeling**: Polynomial regression and curve fitting
